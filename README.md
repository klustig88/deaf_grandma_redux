Deaf Grandma Sinatra:

A simple Sinatra application that has a user input text into a submission form.  Depending on the text that the user
inputs, a response is rendered to the page.  

This is a similation of a Grandma who is deaf.  The user receives a response based on if the text that was submitted was
in all upper case or not.
